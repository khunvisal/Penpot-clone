                    You probably arrived here because you either wanted to understand the Why Penpot or the How
                    Penpot questions. Both are fine and we have grouped those questions attending to that soft
                    categorisation. This FAQ will continue to evolve and, at some point, will probably require more
                    ergonomics, filters and search. For now, let’s see how it goes.</p>

                <h2 class="text-5xl font-bold"> Why Penpot?</h2>
                <p class="text-2xl py-12">These are questions related to the fact that Penpot even exists or what is
                    particularly different and new about it.</p>
                <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold pb-5 pt-5">Who created Penpot? Why?</h3>
                <p class="pb-5">There is a company called <a class="text-green-500 underline" href="">Kaleidos Open
                        Source</a> that has been long known for its commitment to free & open source software and a more
                    diverse and inclusive workplace where cross-domain teams really enjoy working together. Kaleidos
                    launched <a class="underline text-green-500" href="">Taiga</a> a few years ago to deal with the
                    absence of a truly agile open source project management tool. The next major pain in our ranked list
                    of outrageous open source absentees was a design & prototype tool like Figma, Sketch or Invision.
                </p>
                <p class="pb-5">At Kaleidos we believe that the tools that we use to build end products should be as
                    accessible to everyone, regardless of their background, skills or purchasing power. Also, not having
                    a free & open source UX/UI tool that would make devs participate in the design process and bridge
                    the gap between UX/UI and code was a terrible itch for us.</p>
                <p class="pb-5">We created Penpot out of the need to enjoy design freedom for cross-domain teams.</p>
                <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold pb-5 pt-5">Why specifically Open Source?</h3>
                <p class="pb-5">It’s our very personal choice to make sure that we create tools that inject more freedom
                    into the system. Open Source means pursuing a fairer society, where opportunities are more evenly
                    distributed. Software Technology has the unique advantage, compared to other industries and
                    intellectual property, of having almost zero cost to replicate itself, thus providing a wonderful
                    chance to massively distribute the tools for a more digitally sovereign society.</p>
                <p class="pb-5">Besides the pure license aspect of it and its legal framework, Open Source fosters more
                    engaging communities where the lines between user and contributor are often blurred.</p>
                <p class="pb-5">In particular, we chose the very respected Mozilla Public License 2.0 because it made
                    software delivered through the web or a service subject to the same rules as software that runs
                    natively on your operating system.</p>
                <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold pb-5 pt-5">Why is SVG its native format?</h3>
                <p class="pb-5">SVG (Scalar Vector Graphics) is a widely used Open Standard by the<a href="">W3C</a>. It
                    permeates the web, the mobile world and visualisation outputs across a myriad of platforms.</p>
                <p class="pb-5">Embracing SVG was a technical challenge but it was a huge opportunity too. It makes a
                    Penpot design itself valid code already. Moreover, the potential for integrations and
                    interoperability are infinite.</p>
                <p class="pb-5">When you are certain that a part of your design is SVG and you live-export that SVG as
                    part of your code repository, you can have back and forth changes through the SVG files. Also, a
                    “continuous design” process could be finally at hand.</p>
                <p class="pb-5">Using SVG means that there is no translation between a design and its “mathematical”
                    representation. The design is the SVG and the SVG is the design. This is a triumph for cross-domain
                    collaboration.</p>
                <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold pb-5 pt-5">Why is Penpot different from [X proprietary product]?</h3>
                <p class="pb-5">It would be tempting to go on a feature-comparison mode here. That’s not going to
                    happen. In terms of functionality Penpot is just fine already and with every new month, we will be
                    bridging the gap between other well-known tools (founded between 2010 and 2012) and our hectic
                    release cycle.</p>
                <p class="pb-5">What is really different is the combination of four key elements:</p>
                <ol class="list-decimal ml-4">
                    <li class="pb-5 "><strong>Open Source</strong>. This is a game-changer for the design and prototype
                        world. It means you can trust your designs are your own. You can adapt or improve the code or
                        benefit from others doing so. You can host your own Penpot instance (also, native app in the
                        works). You can integrate it the way you want. There’s no limit with technology sovereignty.
                    </li>
                    <li class="pb-5"><strong>SVG</strong>. The fact that we don’t go for yet another proprietary format
                        is a blow of fresh air. SVG is what code needs and wants, making the cooperation between design
                        and code suddenly much easier. </li>
                    <li class="pb-5"><strong>Cross-domain team focus</strong>. Teams that are able to integrate many
                        different skills and backgrounds and still enjoy a fruitful conversation (and project) are
                        amazing to watch. Penpot aims to deliver the perfect tool for visual designers that is
                        wholeheartedly embraced by developers too.</li>
                    <li class="pb-5"><strong>No platform dependencies</strong>. Penpot requires a browser, that’s it. If
                        you want to host your own Penpot instance, that’s fine too. We plan to release a native app
                        bundle later this year.</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="pb-5">There is a theme here. Universal access. That’s why we love to call our product Penpot,
                    there’s nothing more personal and yet more universal than a pot full of pens. It’s all about choice.
                </p>
                <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold pb-5 pt-5">Why did you develop Penpot using Clojure and Clojurescript?
                </h3>
                <p class="pb-5">Penpot is a very specific type of tool that demands high performance on the web. Penpot
                    also has the challenging task of seamlessly manipulating zillions of mathematical objects with no
                    information loss. Functional programming languages like Clojure excel at this.</p>
                <p class="pb-5">It is one of those instances where you absolutely need a specific technology to be able
                    to achieve a robust tool like Penpot in a short period of time.</p>
                <p class="pb-5">Since Clojure is not (yet?) a mainstream programming language, we are making sure that
                    there will be ways to extend Penpot using other more common languages such as Javascript. Also, at
                    the backend level, appropriate APIs will be in place to easily connect Penpot with other platforms.
                </p>
                <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold pb-5 pt-5">Why did you release Penpot as an Alpha?</h3>
                <p class="pb-5">We couldn’t wait any longer. Back in February 2020 we promised that it would take as a
                    year to develop a sort of 1.0. The “alpha” tag might be misleading, it’s quite stable and
                    feature-rich but in some ways it’s still immature with regards to our vision.</p>
                <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold pb-5 pt-5"> Why did Penpot move to Beta?</h3>
                <p class="pb-5">Penpot is labeled as beta from the beginning of November 2021. Since its public launch
                    in February 2021, Penpot capabilities and benefits have grown at an astonishing fast rate.
                    Meanwhile, we constantly came back to one recurring question: Is Penpot really an alpha product
                    anymore?</p>
                <p class="pb-5">The combination of core features, maturity, stability and how comfortable teams seem to
                    be while using it made the trick. Also, we saw amazing validation from the community as a whole
                    (take a look at our github). Learn more about the details behind the change </p>
                <p class="pb-5">Anyway, enjoy it for what it is, we will keep releasing iterations of our hopeful plans.
                </p>
                <hr class="my-20">
                <h2 class="text-5xl font-bold "> How Penpot?</h2>
                <p class="text-2xl py-12"> These are questions related to practical aspects of Penpot or its
                    capabilities.</p>
                <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold pb-5 pt-5"> How do you plan to make Penpot’s development sustainable?</h3>
                <p class="pb-5"><a class="text-green-500 underline" href="">Kaleidos Open Source</a>, the company behind
                    Penpot, has the resources and the team needed to do that. If Penpot really succeeds and demands more
                    and more resources, a bigger team and a bigger infrastructure, we will need to find ways to monetize
                    some aspects of Penpot. Many Open Source platforms have been very successful at that, without
                    reverting to closing up the source code.</p>
                <p class="pb-5">SaaS subscriptions offer a quite valid and straightforward business model on top of Open
                    Source. We are also considering marketplace models à-la-Wordpress or big-enterprise-focused features
                    for supported Penpot deployments à-la-Gitlab. No bullshit Open Core models based on some iteration
                    of a “Tax the rich” sound reasonable but we’re still unsure about what would make sense. At the
                    moment, though, this is something we don’t plan to address until 2023.</p>
                <p class="pb-5">If you would like to know more about our track record, just take a look at Taiga and its
                    AGPL 3.0 licensing model. It’s great to have first-hand experience.</p>
                <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold pb-5 pt-5"> What is this "Kaleidos Ventures SL" stuff I see when I do some
                    research on who's behind Penpot? You guys are a VC or what?</h3>
                <p class="pb-5 ">
                    <li class="italic list-none pb-5">Since we keep getting this question, we decided it was far simpler
                        to just change our company name so we will soon be dropping the “ventures” bit. Still, please
                        read what follows.</li>

                    other startups. Many of us had been free & open source enthusiasts and hackers for over 10 years
                    (mid 90's) already back then, so we wanted to make sure we stood behind our values around technology
                    and society. Thanks to our internal innovation and incubation process (<a
                        class="text-green-500 underline" href="">ΠWEEK</a>),<a class="text-green-500 underline"
                        href="">Taiga</a> was born a few years ago. In recent times, we also needed something like
                    Penpot, so we created an internal prototype, after which we asked ourselves whether it would be
                    challenging but also cool to ditch all third-party consultancy contracts and just focus on OUR free
                    & open source products. We said "Yes! Let's do this!". To name this risky and exciting business
                    shift during pandemic times, it was convenient to create a child company, Kaleidos Ventures SL, and
                    we asked for a bit of seed money to make sure we could build a solid professional tool, but the
                    transition has been flawless and our <a class="text-green-500 underline" href="">main website</a>
                    has remained almost the same, which is very nice. </p>

                <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold pb-5 pt-5"> How can I download and install Penpot for my team?</h3>
                <p class="pb-5">Current private Penpot instances are only requiring basic Docker knowledge. You can run
                    your own Penpot server following these instructions:<a class="text-green-500 underline"
                        href="">help.penpot.app/technical-guide/getting-started</a></p>
                <p class="pb-5"> There’s a community contribution around a docker-less deployment using podman: <br><a
                        class="text-green-500 underline"
                        href="">blog.linuxgrrl.com/2022/01/19/running-penpot-locally-docker-free-with-podman</a></p>
                <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold pb-5 pt-5"> How can I make Penpot work offline?</h3>
                <p class="pb-5"> At the moment that would require that you install Penpot locally and so you connect to
                    localhost. Instructions for this using Docker can be found here: <a class="text-green-500 underline"
                        href="">https://help.penpot.app/technical-guide/getting-started/</a></p>
                <p class="pb-5">For a simpler approach, more akin to downloading a piece of software and running it on
                    top of your operating system, please wait for our Electron-based app bundle later this year.</p>
                <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold pb-5 pt-5"> Where can I find the code?</h3>
                <p class="pb-5"> You can download the code or clone the repository at <a
                        class="text-green-500 underline" href="">Github</a></p>
                <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold pb-5 pt-5">How can I enjoy the best Penpot browser experience?</h3>
                <p class="pb-5"> Cross-browser support is a key aspect of Penpot so we give much thought and care to it.
                </p>
                <p class="pb-5"> Our current preference solely in terms of experience is:</p>
                <ol class="list-decimal ml-4">
                    <li class="pb-5">Chrome (or Chromium/Blink based browsers/Edge)</li>
                    <li class="pb-5">Firefox</li>
                    <li class="pb-5">WebKit (Safari / Epiphany)</li>
                </ol>
                <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold pb-5 pt-5"> How can I enjoy Penpot on the cloud?</h3>
                <p class="pb-5"> The easiest way to enjoy Penpot is quite simple. You simply go to <a
                        class="text-green-500 underline" href="">https://penpot.app</a> and click on the Signup button.
                    You will be asked to create an account. We only ask for an email. There are some authentication
                    providers available, too.</p>
                <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold pb-5 pt-5"> How can I work together with other people?</h3>
                <p class="pb-5">The easiest way to do that in Penpot is to create a team and add projects as you need
                    them. All those projects and files will be available for your team and you will be able to work
                    either asynchronously or simultaneously.</p>
                <p class="pb-5"> A Penpot user can be part of many different teams and have access to all their
                    available projects.</p>
                <p class="pb-5"> Of course, Penpot also gives you the possibility to work on your private projects or
                    drafts.</p>
                <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold pb-5 pt-5"> How can I share my designs with external stakeholders?</h3>
                <p class="pb-5">If you want to have a shareable URL to show your designs you can do it from the VIEW
                    mode: launch it using the PLAY button at the top right of the file, and you'll find a SHARE URL
                    button to create the link at the top right. Copy and send that link for other people to access the
                    design.</p>
                <p class="pb-5">You can always invalidate a shared URL if you don’t wish to continue to make it
                    accessible through that link.</p>
                <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold pb-5 pt-5"> How can I stay up-to-date with the latest Penpot news and
                    what's to come?</h3>
                <p class="pb-5"> We will be sharing our progress and news through different channels:</p>

                <p class=" bg-cyan-100 rounded-sm py-10 px-10"> We are planning to launch a new community space soon
                    to allow for everyone to be part of the conversation.</p>
                <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold pb-5 pt-5">How can I use Penpot together with Inkscape?</h3>
                <p class="pb-5">Inkscape is a very powerful Open Source vector drawing tool. At Penpot we use it daily
                    for our SVG creations. A very common use case we have is to use Inkscape to work with vector
                    illustrations, icon sets and other graphic assets, before importing them into Penpot to create more
                    complete and visually attractive interface designs. There are other tools that can complete your
                    workflow, such as Quant-UX, which is very good for learning about your users’ interactions with your
                    product.</p>
                <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold pb-5 pt-5">How can I learn how to use Penpot?</h3>
                <p class="pb-5"> Right now, our suggested approach would be to take a look at our <a
                        class="text-green-500 underline" href="">Youtube channel</a> and enjoy the quick tutorials on
                    many aspects of Penpot.</p>
                <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold pb-5 pt-5">How can I contribute to Penpot?</h3>
                <p class="pb-5"> We are working on a comprehensive guide on how to contribute to Penpot. There are many
                    ways this can be achieved. Designs, code, testing, reporting bugs, improving documentation, sharing
                    Penpot designs with #MadeWithPenpot, translating Penpot to your favourite language, setting up
                    training sessions, etc.</p>
                <p class="pb-5">For now, we have a rather limited <a class="text-green-500 underline"
                        href="">Contribution guide</a> that you can already use but we plan to improve this very soon.

                <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold pb-5 pt-5">What is in Penpot’s roadmap for the short-/mid-term?</h3>
                <p class="pb-5">Some of the things planned for the near future:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc ml-4 ">
                    <li class="pb-5">Responsive layout (also known as autolayout).</li>
                    <li class="pb-5">Advanced components (states, variants, interactions).</li>
                    <li class="pb-5">Sharing options with fine grained permissions.</li>
                    <li class="pb-5">[2022 - Q4] Taiga confluence, API and plugin framework.</li>
                    <li class="pb-5">... and much more.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="pb-5">You can check the advance of the project at <a class="text-green-500 underline"
                        href="">Taiga</a> </p>
                <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold pb-5 pt-5"> Did the team find a pattern (design, interaction, tool) that
                    could be improved but decided to keep it because the reference tools already made it familiar to the
                    user?</h3>
                <p class="pb-5"> Short answer would be no, we do not keep things from improving because of the potential
                    loss of familiarity.</p>
                <p class="pb-5"> Short answer would be no, we do not keep things from improving because of the potential
                    loss of familiarity.</p>
                <p class="pb-5"> It is true that we are using known patterns to ease the learning curve, this is part of
                    Penpot’s strategy. Given that, we could say that “familiar” is included in our definition of
                    success, but this might be for a different, also interesting, conversation. We do not hide that we
                    have kept an eye not only on Figma but also on many other “usual suspects” (Sketch, Adobe XD,
                    Inkscape, Webflow, Blender...) to study common patterns. However, our design decisions are based not
                    only on previous research but also on testing solutions with users. Therefore, if we were to find
                    that something works better for us in a different way, we’d go for it. Masks and toolbars are some
                    examples of this approach.</p>
